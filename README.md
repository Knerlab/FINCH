# Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) calculations for SIDH
***The code allows one to calculate the CRLB for two different configurations of SIDH:***

***1. Configuration 1: SIDH with one spherical wave and one plane wave***

***2. Configuration 2: SIDH with two spherical waves***

## Config 1: SIDH with one spherical wave and one plane wave
To calculate the CRLB for config 1 the files mentioned below must be run in the following order:

1. *Basic_config_single_spherical_lens.m*

2. *z_r_derivative.m*

3. *SIDH_CRLB.m*

4. *SIDH_CRLB_withnoise.m (For calculating CRLB with noise)*

## Config 2: SIDH with two spherical waves
To calculate the CRLB for config 2 the files mentioned below must be run in the following order:

1. *Basic_config_dual_spherical_lens.m*

2. *z_r_derivative_dual_spherical_wave.m*

3. *SIDH_CRLB.m*

4. *SIDH_CRLB_withnoise.m (For calculating CRLB with noise)*
